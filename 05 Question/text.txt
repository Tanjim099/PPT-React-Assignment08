In React, there are two main ways to define components: class-based components and function-based components. Here are the key differences between the two:

Class-based components:

Syntax: Class-based components are defined as ES6 classes that extend the React.Component class provided by React.

State: Class-based components have their own internal state, which can be initialized in the constructor using this.state. 
State can be modified using the setState() method, triggering re-renders.
Lifecycle methods: Class-based components have lifecycle methods, such as componentDidMount(), componentDidUpdate(), and componentWillUnmount(). 
These methods allow developers to perform actions at specific points in the component's lifecycle.
'this' context: Within class-based components, the this keyword is used to access props, state, and methods.

Complexity: Class-based components can handle complex logic, state management, and side effects with ease. They are often used when components 
require local state, lifecycle methods, or class-specific functionality.

Performance: Class-based components don't optimize re-renders out of the box. Developers need to implement their own shouldComponentUpdate() method or use React.memo() 
to optimize performance.

Function-based components:

Syntax: Function-based components are defined as JavaScript functions. They receive props as input and return React elements to describe what should be rendered.

State: Until React 16.7, function-based components were stateless and couldn't manage their own internal state. However, with the introduction of 
React hooks in React 16.8, function-based components can now manage state using the useState() hook and have lifecycle functionality using useEffect() and other hooks.

Lifecycle methods: Function-based components use hooks like useEffect() to perform side effects and mimic the behavior of lifecycle methods in class components.
'this' context: Since function-based components don't use classes, there is no 'this' keyword within the component's scope. Instead, props can be accessed directly 
as function arguments.

Simplicity: Function-based components have a simpler syntax and are easier to read, write, and understand. They promote a functional programming style and can 
be more lightweight and concise than class-based components.

Performance: Function-based components using hooks come with built-in optimizations for re-renders. They leverage the React reconciler to intelligently 
update only the necessary parts of the component tree, resulting in potential performance improvements.
