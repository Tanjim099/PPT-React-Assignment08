
Prop drilling in React refers to the scenario where props need to be passed through multiple intermediate components that don't actually use those props. 
It can occur when a component needs to pass data down to a deeply nested child component that is several levels deep in the component tree.

Prop drilling can lead to code verbosity and make it harder to maintain and refactor the codebase. It violates the principle of encapsulation, 
as components that don't need the props are still required to pass them down.

To avoid prop drilling and make the code more maintainable and scalable, you can consider the following approaches:
1. Use Context API
2. Implement Redux or other state management libraries
3. Use React Router's useParams
4. Component composition and inversion of control
5. Use React's memoization techniques
